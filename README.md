# RevitLifeSaver
Workflow automation for Life Safety Checking in Revit - Dynamo and API addins.

This is the product of the 24-hour BeyondAEC Hackathon in September of 2018.

As with any hackathon product, it was made with a variety of compromises - so it may not yet be suitable for production usage. Review carefully.

We do help to spend a little time revisiting it soon, to remove some of the compromises made.
